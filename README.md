# py-rng
A fangame of Sol's RNG made entirely in Python.
UwU
# Needed Libraries
now then,
you would need the following libraries to run the game:
random
time
os
survey
tabulate
pickle
sys

uhh install them idk

#Playing the game
I would suggest you play in your terminal, fullscreen ofc.
After you install all the needed libraries(using pip or unless i figure out a way to do it for you),
cd into the directory where you have stored the game and run it!

Enjoy??
